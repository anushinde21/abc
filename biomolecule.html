Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large
group of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common
examples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of
them have a general formula, Cx
(H2O)y
, and were considered as hydrates
of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example,
the molecular formula of glucose (C6H12O6
) fits into this general formula,
C6
(H2O)6
. But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be
classified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH3COOH) fits into
this general formula, C2
(H2O)2
 but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly,
rhamnose, C6H12O5
 is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition.
A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific
functional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as
